**AIM:**

To implement  D flipflop using verilog and validating their functionality using their functional tables

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:**

Quartus prime

**THEORY**

**D Flip-Flop**

D flip-flop operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. Whereas, D latch operates with enable signal. That means, the output of D flip-flop is insensitive to the changes in the input, D except for active transition of the clock signal. The circuit diagram of D flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has single input D and two outputs Qtt & Qtt’. The operation of D flip-flop is similar to D Latch. But, this flip-flop affects the outputs only when positive transition of the clock signal is applied instead of active enable. The following table shows the state table of D flip-flop.

Therefore, D flip-flop always Hold the information, which is available on data input, D of earlier positive transition of clock signal. From the above state table, we can directly write the next state equation as Qt+1t+1 = D

Next state of D flip-flop is always equal to data input, D for every positive transition of the clock signal. Hence, D flip-flops can be used in registers, shift registers and some of the counters.

**Procedure**

/* write all the steps invloved */

**PROGRAM**

```
module EX8DFF(d, clk, rst, q);
  input d, clk, rst;
  output reg q;

  always @(negedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst)
      q <= 0; // Reset the flip-flop
    else
      q <= d; // D input is passed to Q on the negative clock edge
  end
endmodule
```

**RESULTS**

Thus, the D Flip-Flop with negative edge triggering is designed, and its functionality is
validated using the truth table and timing diagrams.
